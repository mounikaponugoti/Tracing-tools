# Tracing-tools
Collection of pin based tracing and profiling tools for control flow and data flow (memory reads and memory writes)

# mProfile
mProfile is a Pin tool developed to record the control-flow (branches, calls, and return) and/or data-flow 
(memory reads and writes) of multithreaded programs. This tool can collect the statistics related to control-flow and 
data-flow instructions without recording the traces. It is also capable of collect periodic statistics when the program 
is running. This helps the user to analyze the hot regions with in the given program. To learn more about how to use
